cd langfuse
docker compose up
```
2. Once it is up and running you can access the observability at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Create a new user id and password to sign in
4. Create a api key from settings and copy the secret key and public key in .env file as shown:
    `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-<secret_key>`
